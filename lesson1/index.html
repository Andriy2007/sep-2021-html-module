    <ul>
        In 1919, Tommy leads the Peaky Blinders into appropriating a consignment of guns from the Birmingham Small Arms factory. Inspector Campbell is tasked by Winston Churchill to find the guns and, unbeknownst to Tommy, his new barmaid Grace Burgess is working undercover for Inspector Campbell. Tommy is also involved with fixing horse races, which has potential for conflict with Billy Kimber, who runs the races. Campbell instructs Grace to get close to Tommy so that he can find the location of the guns; Grace attends the Cheltenham races as Tommy's date and Tommy saves Grace from harm after initially offering her to Kimber as part of a deal for the Peaky Blinders to become the security at Kimber's establishment. Tommy obtains a betting licence for his business and hires Grace as his secretary. Grace and Tommy become romantically involved and Grace tells Inspector Campbell, if she gives him the location of the guns, he has to leave Tommy and his family alone. Grace gives up the location to Inspector Campbell and resigns service to the crown. As she has resigned, and the guns found, with the exception of one, Inspector Campbell proposes marriage, which Grace rejects. Tommy gathers the Peaky Blinders and another family, the Lees, and they take on Kimber's men; this leads to a confrontation where Tommy shoots Kimber dead. Tommy meets Grace and she tells him she loves him and will go to London for a few days. The series ends with a gunshot as Campbell confronts Grace at the railway station.

    <li>Series 3</li>
    <ul>Two years later, in 1924, Tommy and Grace get married. Meanwhile, a refugee from Russia, named Anton Kaledin, makes contact with the Peaky Blinders, offering the code "Constantine" as confirmation for the money-exchange meeting with the young Duchess Tatiana Petrovna. Tommy informs her that Kaledin provided the wrong code name, meaning the man must be killed. In the end, Arthur kills the impostor. Tommy inspects armoured vehicles for a business deal with Father Hughes. He meets with Mr. Romanov, who pays him for murdering Kaledin with a sapphire. Tommy later finds a card under his son's pillow, which reads "Charles Shelby - R.I.P.". Grace wears the sapphire, which Tommy gave her, to the Shelby Charity Foundation dinner. Father Hughes informs Tommy that the Russians want to inspect the vehicles. Tatiana tells Tommy that the sapphire Grace is wearing was cursed by a gypsy. Tommy attempts convincing Grace to take off the necklace when a man shouts "For Angel!" and shoots Grace dead. Tommy travels to Wales with the sapphire necklace, where he confers with a gypsy, whom he asks whether it is cursed. He returns home with some sense of normality having left the necklace with the woman. Arthur and John have procured a man called Vicente Changretta, an Italian-American Mafia member who Tommy threatens to torture, but Arthur shoots him in the head as an act of mercy. Tatiana sees Tommy to his car; he tells her that Hughes is betraying them to the Soviets and offers to kill him for free. Easter arrives and Tommy announces a plan to his brothers: they will have been hired to provide the Russians with weapons for a rebellion stolen from a train and will, in turn, be paid in jewels but, believing the Russians will betray him, Tommy plans to break into their vault. Polly goes to church while drunk and during confession she inadvertently reveals Tommy's plan to assassinate Father Hughes to the priest, who tells Father Hughes about it. Knowing he is the target, Hughes foils Tommy's attempt on his life and watches him being seriously injured by his minders. Three months later, Tommy has recovered and the planned massive heist involving the Russians is drawing near. Tommy enlists the Peaky Blinders' old antagonist Alfie Solomons to appraise the Russian's jewels. Tommy's son, Charlie, is kidnapped. Father Hughes reveals to Tommy that he knows about his subterfuge. He demands the jewels as payment and for Tommy himself to blow up the train, which must kill six people, in exchange for the safe return of his son. Tommy agrees unconditionally. After some investigation he discovers that Alfie Solomons divulged the plans to Father Hughes. During a confrontation, Michael kills Alfie's associate, but Michael talks Tommy out of killing Alfie. Tommy figures out where Charlie is being held and sends Michael to retrieve him and kill Father Hughes. At the same time Arthur and John set off to carry out the train bombing in case Michael cannot rescue Charlie in time. Even though Michael is successful, word does not reach the Shelbys in time, and the train is blown up. Tommy returns home to distribute the loot to his accomplices, but at the end of the meeting announces that the police are at the residence to arrest everyone. The rest of the Peaky Blinders and Shelby family are taken away in handcuffs.</ul>

    <ul>As Arthur, John, Michael and Polly prepare to hang for their crimes, Tommy's reprieve comes just in time to save their lives. A year later, the Shelby family is scattered and estranged from one another. Each of the Shelbys receives a letter from Luca Changretta, a leader in New York's American Mafia, marking him or her for death in retribution for the murder of Angel and Vincente, Luca's brother and father. Tommy and Ada attempt to convince the others to meet on Boxing Day, believing that they will be safer if they come back together. However, when Tommy discovers and kills a mafia agent among his staff, he realises the assassination attempts are due to take place on Christmas Day and gets word to the rest of the family. Michael goes to collect John and Esme, with whom Tommy could not get in contact. A cart pulls up, and John and Michael are shot several times. Michael survives his injuries but John is killed. In the wake of his death, Tommy and the rest of the Shelby family agree to put their differences aside while they deal with the mafia threat. Tommy suggests contacting Aberama Gold, a contract killer. Changretta visits Tommy and sets several bullets on the table, stating that each is for a member of the Shelby family. He plans to keep Tommy alive until the rest are dead but insists that their vendetta be an honourable one, with Tommy agreeing not to involve the police or the death of children or civilians. The Peaky Blinders are lured by the Changrettas into a chase on the streets of Birmingham, where it becomes clear that the Changrettas are outmatched. Tommy has figured out Polly and Michael have betrayed him but goes to the meeting Polly has set for him and finds himself engaged in a shootout with Changretta's men.

As Tommy is getting the upper hand, Arthur enters the distillery and shoots Luca. It is revealed that Tommy had Arthur fake his death to lure Luca into the trap. The Shelbys celebrate the end of the vendetta at Tommy's countryside estate, and it is announced that Tommy will take a holiday from the business. Tommy confronts Alfie for his betrayal, who reveals he did so knowing Tommy would track him down and kill him, and that he has cancer. Tommy then shoots Alfie and proceeds to take his holiday.
